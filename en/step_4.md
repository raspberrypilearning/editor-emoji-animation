The `sow_seeds()` function contains the code that tells the seeds to move down from the top of the screen. 

<div class="c-project-code">

def sow_seeds():
    global seed_position
    if seed_position < 300:
        seed_position = seed_position + 5
        text('ü´ò', 200, seed_position)

</div>

Change one of the numbers in the code so that the seeds move faster or slower.

**Test:** Run your code and see the seeds moving faster or slower. 

You will adjust the other timings in the next step.
