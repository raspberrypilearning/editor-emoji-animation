The global variable `grow` contains a frame number.

<div class="c-project-code">

language: python
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 6

grow = 150

--- /code ---
</div>

The `flower()` function contains code to check whether this frame number has passed, and if so, draw the flower.

def flower():
    if seed_position >= 300:
        text('üå±', 200, 300)    
    if frame_count > grow: 
        draw_background()
        text('üå∑', 200, 300)

</div>

Change the frame number to change when your emoji appears. 

**Test:** Run your code and you should see the emoji you chose appearing earlier or later.

### Tip

You can create more variables containing frame numbers, and use them to control when different things happen in your animation.
