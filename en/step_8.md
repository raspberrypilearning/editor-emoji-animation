➡️ Make your own animation
--- /task --- 

Now it's time for you to get creative and make your own animation! Here are some ideas for inspiration:

+ Change the background — use different colours or draw some shapes 
+ Use your own emojis
+ Specify the coordinates where you want each emoji to appear
+ Use the frame number to specify when your emoji appears
+ Make the emojis move across the screen
+ Draw shapes to create an effect (like the smoke effect from [Rocket launch](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/editor-rocket-launch/editor){:target="_blank"})
+ Use `random` to make emojis appear in random places
+ Use `mouse_pressed` to make the animation interactive (you used this in [Target practice](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/editor-target-practice/editor){:target="_blank"})
