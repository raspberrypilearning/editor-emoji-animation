The `sow_seeds()` function contains code to draw the seed emoji at a `x`, `y` coordinate.

def sow_seeds():
    global seed_position
    if seed_position < 300:
        seed_position = seed_position + 5
        text('ü´ò', 200, seed_position)
--- /code ---
</div>

Change the value `200` and the value of the variable `seed_position` so that the seeds start in a different place. 

**Test:** Run your code and you should see the seeds start in a different place.

### Tip

You might also want to change when the seeds stop, or the direction they move in. Can you work out which values to change to do this?
