The `sow_seeds()` function contains code to draw the seed emoji at an x, y coordinate.

def sow_seeds():
    global seed_position
    if seed_position < 300:
        seed_position = seed_position + 5
        text('ü´ò', 200, seed_position)
--- /code ---
</div>

Change the x value (`200`) and the y value (the variable `seed_position`) so that the seeds start in a different place.

**Test:** Run your code and see the seeds start in the new position.

### Tip

You might also want to change when the seeds stop, or the direction they move in. Can you work out which values to change in the code above to do this?
